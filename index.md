# Dataness

Dataness is a code generator that creates code for DataAccess and BusinessLogic. 

Out of the box the library comes with support for C# language and MsSql and MySql databases. 

It's possible to extend the library and use it for generating code in other programming languages and databases.

## Planned Features

I'm still working on expanding the features of the generator, so these are among others, some of the features I want to add in the near future:

- Support for database Views
- Pagination
- Better support for manually implemented logic
